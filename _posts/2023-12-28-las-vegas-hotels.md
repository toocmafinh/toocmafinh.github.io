# Las Vegas Hotel Dashboard: A Data Visualisation Journey

*Excited to share my latest project for the #Data_Visualisation challenge, focusing on the vibrant world of Las Vegas hotels! ðŸŒŸ Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the process I followed to create an interactive dashboard using #TableauDesktop.*

## Reviewing the Las Vegas Dataset
The journey began with a thorough review of the Las Vegas dataset. This dataset provides valuable insights into various hotels, including their locations, review scores, capacity, and more. Understanding the data was crucial for creating a meaningful visualisation.

## Defining the Business/User Persona
For this project, I identified a business user persona: hotel managers in Las Vegas looking to improve their services and attract more guests. By focusing on their needs, I crafted a narrative that emphasizes the importance of customer reviews and hotel capacity in driving business decisions.

## Identifying Key Data Elements
Key data elements included:

- Location: Understanding where hotels are situated.
- Review Scores: Analyzing customer feedback to gauge hotel performance.
- Hotel Capacity: Evaluating how many guests each hotel can accommodate.

These elements were pivotal in guiding the visualisation choices.

## Choosing Visualisations
I opted for several visualisation methods:

- Maps: To illustrate hotel locations and their geographical distribution.
- Bar Charts: For comparing review scores across different hotels.
- Tables: To provide detailed information on hotel capacity and average room numbers.

These choices enhance clarity and allow users to quickly grasp key insights.

## Developing the Interactive Dashboard
Using #TableauDesktop, I created an interactive dashboard named Las Vegas Hotels. This dashboard allows users to filter by review scores, explore hotel locations on a map, and view detailed statistics at a glance.

- Key Components of the Dashboard
- User Location Map: Shows hotel distribution across different regions.
- Review Score Overview: Highlights average scores and trends over time.
- Hotel Capacity Metrics: Provides insights into the number of rooms and overall hotel capacity.

This dashboard is designed to empower hotel managers with the insights they need to make informed decisions and enhance their offerings.
