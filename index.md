Hey!
I'm Phuong :D
I write because I'm afraid someday I might forget everything or I might be forgotten.

**Let's call this the navigation xD**

People call me by my name, or To.oc or Béo, or 秋芳, or just 芳.

My most recent favorite series is Someday or one day -「想見你」.

My favorite quote from this series is "唯有你也想見我的時候，我們見面才有意義。"

I was born and raised in a sweet family and have been much influenced by my sister. 
I love reading, writing, sleeping, traveling, doodling, learning languages, collecting little stuff, painting my nails, creating some crazy things, and watching Chinese/Taiwanese movies with my sister.
I'm kinda weird. Sometimes I wonder if I can keep buying cute things and talking about politics and religions at the same time, even when I'm a grown-up.
My dream never stops at a stable life and I have always desired to do something that helps this planet become a nice place to live.
I have been always appreciating what I have, but I will continue realizing the goals I set.

I started writing when I was in 5th grade, not as a hobby, but as a self-assignment. Writing's naturally become my habit when I need to secretly express myself. I've been switching a lot between different platforms, due to several reasons. I hope that I can finally settle down here so that I can truly feel like it's the home of my mind.
