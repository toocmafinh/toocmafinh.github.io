# About Me

Hi there! 

I’m Phuong. I'm currently based in Sydney, Australia.

I'm  an aspiring data analyst who loves turning complex data into meaningful insights. With a knack for tools like Python, Power BI, and SQL, I enjoy diving deep into data to uncover stories that can help businesses solve their problems.

I’ve had the pleasure of working on various projects, from optimizing marketing strategies for non-profit organisations to enhancing customer engagement for businesses. I thrive in team settings and believe that collaboration sparks the best ideas.

When I’m not crunching numbers, you can find me drawing and letting my creativity flow. It’s a wonderful way for me to relax and explore new concepts. I’m always eager to connect with others who share my enthusiasm for data and creativity!
